# MoltFi — On-chain guardrails for AI agent trading

Your AI agent wants to trade crypto on your behalf. But if the guardrails live in the agent's code, a bug or bad prompt can bypass them. MoltFi puts the limits on-chain — your agent literally cannot exceed them.

**You** set the rules. **Your agent** trades within them. **Smart contracts** enforce every limit.

## How it works

1. **You connect your wallet and create a vault** — You set spending limits: max trade size, daily volume cap, which tokens are allowed. These get written to a smart contract on Base.

2. **Your agent registers and gets access** — Your agent reads a skill file, registers with MoltFi, and gets an API key. It can now trade within your vault — but only within your limits.

3. **Your agent sends trade requests in plain English** — "Swap 0.01 WETH to USDC." MoltFi interprets the request, then the smart contract checks it against your limits before any funds move.

4. **Every trade is verified on-chain** — If the trade is within your limits, it executes on Uniswap V3. If it exceeds them, the transaction reverts automatically. Every trade has a Basescan link you can verify.

```
Your Agent → MoltFi Vault → AgentPolicy (checks limits) → Uniswap V3 (executes swap)
                                  ↑
                         Reverts if over limits
```

## What the smart contract enforces

These aren't software settings. They're on-chain rules that revert the transaction if violated.

- **Max per trade** — Every swap is checked against your per-trade limit
- **Daily spending cap** — Cumulative daily volume tracked on-chain, resets every 24h
- **Token allowlist** — Only tokens you approved can be traded
- **Instant revocation** — Freeze all agent trading with one transaction

## For agents

If your agent can make HTTP calls, it can use MoltFi. No SDK, no blockchain knowledge required.

```bash
# 1. Register (once) — returns API key + vault address
curl -X POST https://moltfi.app/api/agent/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"humanWallet": "0xYOUR_WALLET", "agentName": "MyAgent"}'

# 2. Trade (anytime) — smart contract enforces limits on every trade
curl -X POST https://moltfi.app/api/agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "swap 0.001 WETH to USDC"}'
```

Your agent sends plain English. MoltFi handles interpretation, policy checks, and execution. See the full [skill file](skill/SKILL.md) for all available commands.

## For humans

Open the dashboard to:
- **Create a vault** with spending limits written to a smart contract
- **Deposit or withdraw** ETH anytime — you're the owner, the agent can only trade
- **Update guardrails** — change limits, add/remove tokens, revoke access
- **Monitor activity** — every trade with a Basescan link and guardrail check proof
