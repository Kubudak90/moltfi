## 1. THE HACKATHON

### The Synthesis 2026
- Online hackathon, judged by AI agent judges + humans
- Building: March 13 – March 22 (11:59 PM PST)
- Winners: March 25
- Theme: "The infrastructure underneath your agent determines whether you can trust how it operates. Ethereum gives us that trust."

### 4 Problem Briefs (from hackathon)
1. **Agents that Pay** — No way to scope spending, verify correctness, guarantee settlement. Design space: scoped permissions, on-chain settlement, conditional payments, auditable history.
2. **Agents that Trust** — Trust flows through centralized registries. Design space: decentralized identity, on-chain reputation.
3. **Agents that Cooperate** — No neutral enforcement layer. Design space: smart contract enforcement, on-chain commitments.
4. **Agents that Keep Secrets** — Every interaction creates metadata. Design space: privacy-preserving operations.

**We're targeting #1: Agents that Pay.**

**OUR TARGET TRACKS (submit to all that fit, max 10 + Open):**

| # | UUID | Track | Prize | What They Want | How We Qualify |
|---|------|-------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | `fdb76d08` | Open Track | $28,134 | Community-funded, judges contribute | Always submit |
| 2 | `ea3b3669` | Venice Private Agents | $5,750/$3,450/$2,300 | "Agents that reason over sensitive data without exposure, producing trustworthy outputs for public systems: onchain workflows, multi-agent coordination, governance, and operational decisions." | Venice for private strategy analysis — financial data never exposed to AI provider |
| 3 | `020214c1` | Uniswap Agentic Finance | $2,500/$1,500/$1,000 | "Integrate the Uniswap API to give your agent the ability to swap, bridge, and settle value onchain. Agents that trade, coordinate, or invent primitives." | AgentGuardRouter wraps Uniswap V3, real verified swap on Basescan |
| 4 | `bf374c21` | Autonomous Trading Agent (Base) | 3x ~$1,667 | "Novel strategies and proven profitability. Go beyond simple strategies and break new ground in complexity." | Our vault+policy architecture IS a novel strategy framework for autonomous trading |
| 5 | `5e445a07` | stETH Agent Treasury (Lido) | $2,000/$1,000 | "Contract primitive that lets human give AI agent yield-bearing budget backed by stETH WITHOUT giving agent access to principal. Only yield flows to agent." | **THIS IS LITERALLY OUR VAULT.** Human deposits, agent trades yield only, principal locked. MUST integrate wstETH. |
| 6 | `3bf41be9` | ERC-8004 Agents With Receipts | $2,000/$1,500/$500 | "Build agent system with ERC-8004 integration." Shared track with PL_Genesis. | We have ERC-8004 token #34950, registered on-chain |
| 7 | `dcaf0b1b` | Bankr LLM Gateway | $3,000/$1,500/$500 | "Use single API to access 20+ models and connect to real onchain execution through Bankr wallets and tools." | Could use Bankr as execution layer for vault trades |
| 8 | `0d69d56a` | MetaMask Delegations | $3,000/$1,500/$500 | "Use MetaMask Delegation Framework — gator-cli, Smart Accounts Kit, or direct contract integration." | Human delegates trading rights to agent via delegations |
| 9 | `f50e3118` | Best Use of Locus | $2,000/$500/$500 | "Must use Locus wallets, spending controls, pay-per-use APIs as CORE to product. Auto-DQ without working Locus integration." | Would need to integrate Locus wallet — hard requirement |
| 10 | `6f0e3d7d` | Agent Services on Base | 3x ~$1,667 | "Agent that provides services to other agents/humans, discoverable on Base, accepts x402 payments." | AgentGuard as a service — agents pay x402 to use our vault infrastructure |

**CRITICAL INSIGHT — Lido stETH Agent Treasury track:**
Their description is EXACTLY our product: "lets a human give an AI agent a yield-bearing operating budget backed by stETH, without ever giving the agent access to the principal." We MUST add wstETH to the vault. This is a $3K track and we're a perfect fit.

**Max potential: ~$50K+ across all tracks if we place well**

## 2. WHAT WE'VE BUILT

### Smart Contracts (Base Sepolia — deployed, real, on-chain)

**AgentPolicy.sol** — `0x63649f61F29CE6dC9415263F4b727Bc908206Fbc`
- Policy engine. Human calls `setPolicy(agent, maxPerAction, dailyLimit)`.
- `enforceAndRecord(agent, token, amount)` — checks policy + records volume. Reverts if over limit.
- `checkAction(agent, token, amount)` — view-only check.
- `approveToken(agent, token)` / `removeToken(agent, token)` — token allowlist.
- `agentOwner[agent]` = the human who set the policy. Only that address can change it.
- `dailySpent[agent][day]` tracks volume. Resets daily.
- **Key constraint:** `msg.sender` must be the human who called `setPolicy`. Agent can't change own policy.

**AgentGuardRouter.sol** — `0x5Cc04847CE5A81319b55D34F9fB757465D3677E6`
- Wrapper around Uniswap V3 SwapRouter02 (`0x94cC0AaC535CCDB3C01d6787D6413C739ae12bc4`)
- `swap(tokenIn, tokenOut, fee, amountIn, amountOutMinimum)` — calls `POLICY.enforceAndRecord()`, then forwards to Uniswap.
- Agent must have approved this contract for tokenIn (ERC20 approve).
- If policy check fails → entire TX reverts, nothing moves.
- `checkSwap(agent, tokenIn, amountIn)` — view-only pre-check.

**AgentVault.sol** — v1 demo at `0x333896c4c1b58c5c9b56967301c008C073Bd2279`, deployed via VaultFactory v2
- Holds user funds. Only owner (human) can deposit/withdraw. Only agent can trade via executeSwap().
- executeSwap() routes through AgentGuardRouter → AgentPolicy check → Uniswap
- Agent CANNOT withdraw or bypass the router — guardrails enforced by design
- **Lido integration:** stakeETH() stakes via Lido → stETH → wstETH, tracks principal vs yield
- **tradeYield():** Agent can ONLY trade yield above principal — principal is locked
- **availableYield():** View function showing tradeable yield amount
- **migrateTo():** Owner can move all funds to a new vault (upgradeability)
- Constructor: owner (human), agent, router, policy — owner passed explicitly for factory deploys

**VaultFactory.sol** — `0x672E6aD29eA629398F4Ee29f51ad6Ad3f9869774`
- Deploys AgentVault instances for users in ONE transaction
- createVault(agent, maxPerAction, dailyLimit, tokens[]) → deploys vault + sets policy + approves tokens
- updatePolicy(vault, max, daily) — only vault owner can call
- approveToken/removeToken — manage allowed tokens per vault
- revokePolicy(vault) — emergency stop, only vault owner
- getVaults(user) — returns all vaults for a user
- User = msg.sender (whoever calls createVault owns the vault)

**AgentGuard.sol** — Written, NOT deployed
- Uniswap v4 hook version (uses `beforeSwap` to enforce policy at protocol level)
- Needs PoolManager infrastructure — more complex to deploy
- Same policy logic as AgentPolicy but embedded in the hook

### Verified Real Swap
- **0.005 WETH → 2.045 USDC** through AgentGuardRouter → Uniswap V3 pool
- TX: `0x1abcce6a0d00eccdc303a4f7197a8b8a4f90b86661059e199dda45d3037422d1`
- Basescan: https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x1abcce6a0d00eccdc303a4f7197a8b8a4f90b86661059e199dda45d3037422d1
- Policy check passed (0.005 ETH < 1 ETH max), volume recorded on-chain

### Current Policy On-Chain
- Agent: `0x90d9c75f3761c02Bf3d892A701846F6323e9112D` (Kyro's wallet — used for demo)
- Max trade size: 1 ETH
- Daily volume cap: 5 ETH
- Volume today: 0.005 ETH
- Remaining: 4.995 ETH
- Approved tokens: WETH ✓, USDC depends on which agent

### Web App (Next.js — http://100.71.117.120:3002)

**Architecture:** Tab-based navigation. Each feature is its own page. Shared AgentContext provider for wallet/vault/agent state across all pages.

**Pages (6 tabs + landing):**
- **Landing** (`/`) — Product marketing page (problem/solution/how it works/tech stack)
- **Vault** (`/dashboard`) — Balances, deposit ETH, agent info, create vault
- **Strategy** (`/strategy`) — AI generates 3 strategies via Venice, user approves one, agent runs autonomously within on-chain guardrails. "Approve & Start Agent" → "Agent Running" with green pulse.
- **Activity** (`/activity`) — Trade history with Basescan links. Shows verified swap (0.005 WETH → 2.045 USDC).
- **Chat** (`/chat`) — Full-page Venice AI chat with suggestion prompts. Private inference, zero data retention. (NOTE: chat architecture needs rethinking — currently a separate Venice agent, not the user's OpenClaw agent. Parking for now.)
- **Market** (`/market`) — Live ETH price, stETH APR, Base gas, protocol cards (Lido, Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
- **Guardrails** (`/guardrails`) — Explains how on-chain enforcement works (4 steps), shows current limits, daily usage bar, approved tokens

**UX flow:**
1. Not connected → "Connect Your Wallet"
2. Connected, no agent → Copy-paste instructions to send to your AI agent
3. Agent registered, no vault → "Create Vault" button with explainer (wallet confirmation, ~$0.03 fee)
4. Vault active → Full dashboard with tabs, deposit, strategies, chat

**Components:**
- `NavTabs` — top-level tab navigation (Vault, Strategy, Activity, Chat, Market, Guardrails)
- `ConnectWallet` — wallet connection with hydration fix (mounted state guard)
- `AgentContext` — shared provider for agents, vaults, vaultData, rates across all pages

**API routes:**
- `/api/agent/register` — POST: agent registers, GET: lookup by human/agent wallet
- `/api/vault/status` — GET: real on-chain vault state (balances, policy, usage)
- `/api/uniswap/quote` — POST: Uniswap Trading API quotes (tokenIn, tokenOut, amount, swapper). Uses API key from env.
- `/api/chat` — POST: Venice AI chat (llama-3.3-70b, zero-retention)
- `/api/rates` — GET: live market data (CoinGecko ETH price, Lido stETH APR, Base gas)
- `/api/skill` — GET: serves unified SKILL.md for agents to curl
- `/api/policy` — GET: on-chain policy state
- `/api/ens` — GET: ENS resolution

**Real data sources (NO mock data):**
- ETH price → CoinGecko API
- stETH APR → Lido API (7-day SMA)
- Gas → Base Sepolia RPC (eth_gasPrice)
- Vault balances → on-chain reads via viem
- Policy state → on-chain reads via viem
- Swap quotes → Uniswap Trading API

### Agent Skill (`~/repos/agentguard/skill/SKILL.md`) — UNIFIED, COMPREHENSIVE

  8. Check available yield (GET /api/vault/yield)
  9. Get market data (GET /api/rates)
  10. Chat/strategy analysis (POST /api/chat)
- Includes autonomous operation guide with recommended heartbeat routine
- All contract addresses, token addresses, guardrail explanation
- Agent installs skill → asks human for wallet → registers → done

---

## 4. FIRM DECISIONS (Rodrigo said these — DO NOT REVISIT EVER)

1. **NO MOCK DATA. EVER.** Real API/RPC/DB or show nothing. No hardcoded prices, fake TX hashes, setTimeout animations. Violated 3 times already (2026-02-19, 2026-03-20 x2).

2. **NO wallet address pasting.** The agent already knows its wallet. Copy-pasting an address is 2020 UX.

3. **Agent does NOT set its own policy.** That defeats the entire purpose. The HUMAN sets limits on the agent.

4. **User CONNECTS their wallet.** The vault model requires it — human deposits funds, signs policy transactions. MetaMask/WalletConnect on the dashboard.

5. **Product should be a SKILL.** An OpenClaw skill that the human installs on their agent. The skill handles registration. The human sets limits on the dashboard.

6. **Terms:** "trade size" / "daily volume" — NOT "spending" or "spending limits." Agents trade, they don't spend.

7. **Dashboard = control center.** Wallet connection, deposits, guardrail configuration, monitoring. The human manages the vault here.

8. **AgentVault is the core.** Funds live in the vault, not the agent's wallet. Agent can ONLY trade through the vault → router → policy path. No bypass possible.

9. **Honest about sponsors.** Only claim integrations that actually exist and work.

---

## 5. SOLVED PROBLEMS

### A. How does the agent register? ✅ SOLVED
- Agent installs AgentGuard skill → asks human for wallet address → POSTs to `/api/agent/register`
- Links agentWallet + humanWallet in backend DB
- Dashboard auto-discovers registered agents when human connects wallet

### B. How does the human set limits? ✅ SOLVED
- Human connects wallet on dashboard (ConnectKit)
- Sets guardrails via sliders → clicks "Create Vault" → signs one TX via VaultFactory
- VaultFactory deploys vault + sets policy + approves tokens in single transaction
- Human can update guardrails anytime (signs `updatePolicy` TX)
- Emergency stop button revokes agent's policy entirely

### C. How does linking work? ✅ SOLVED
- Human's wallet address is the link between agent and dashboard
- Agent registers with human's wallet → dashboard queries by connected wallet → agent appears
- No pairing codes needed. Trust is established by human installing the skill on their own agent.

### D. End-to-end user journey ✅ SOLVED
```
1. Human has an OpenClaw agent with a wallet
2. Human goes to dashboard → connects wallet → sees "Connect Your Agent" with copy buttons
3. Human sends skill URL to agent → agent curls skill.md → learns how to register
4. Human tells agent their wallet address → agent POSTs to /api/agent/register
5. Human refreshes dashboard → agent appears → sets guardrails → clicks "Create Vault"
6. One TX: vault deployed + policy set + tokens approved
7. Human deposits ETH into vault
8. Human generates strategies via Venice AI → picks one
9. Agent trades through vault → AgentGuardRouter → policy check → Uniswap
10. Human monitors on dashboard, can update guardrails or emergency stop anytime
```

### E. Empty state UX ✅ SOLVED
- 4-state dashboard: not connected → no agent → no vault → active
- Each state shows exactly what the user needs to do next
- No confusing pipeline or empty charts when nothing is set up

### REMAINING UNSOLVED
- **Deploy Strategy button** — doesn't execute yet (needs agent-side execution logic)
- **Vault upgradeability** — migrateTo() exists but no proxy pattern for seamless upgrades
- **Multi-vault management** — factory supports it but dashboard only shows first vault

## 7. COMPETITION

Others doing agent wallet guardrails:
- **Openfort** — smart wallets with policy rules
- **Coinbase Agentic Wallets** — CDP-managed agent wallets
- **Alchemy** — smart account infrastructure
- **Privy** — embedded wallets with server-side controls
- **AgentVault** — vault-based spending controls
- **AxonFi** — DeFi guardrails
- **ProofGate** — proof-based access control

**All of them are wallet providers.** Our angle: AgentGuard works with ANY existing wallet. It's a standalone contract, not a wallet.

## 11. THE PLAN — AI VAULT MANAGER (2026-03-21)

### New Direction (Rodrigo, March 21)

**Product pivot:** AgentGuard is no longer just "guardrails for agents." It's an **AI Vault Manager** — a platform where humans manage their DeFi money through their AI agent, with on-chain guardrails.

**The problem Rodrigo described:**
- Everyone has AI agents now. Everyone needs yield from DeFi because banks don't pay enough.
- But nobody knows how to do DeFi properly — it's complex, easy to make mistakes, too many protocols.
- Old school: connect wallet to Uniswap, figure it out yourself.
- New school: give your money to your AI agent, set strategy + limits on our platform, agent executes.
- Like having a financial advisor, but it's your own AI with blockchain-enforced limits.

**Key insight:** We don't hold anyone's money. We provide the platform to connect your AI agent and manage it — strategy, guardrails, monitoring. Think of it like a stock portfolio tracker (Fidelity, Robinhood) but for DeFi with an AI agent doing the execution.

**The financial advisor analogy:**
- You don't just hand money to an advisor and say "do whatever"
- They assess your risk tolerance, goals, timeline
- They propose a strategy, you approve it
- They execute within agreed bounds
- You monitor via reports/dashboard
- Same thing here, but the advisor is an AI agent and the bounds are on-chain

### Architecture (4 layers)
1. **On-chain layer** — AgentPolicy + GuardRouter (ALREADY BUILT, enforces limits regardless)
2. **Execution layer** — reads positions, calls protocols (Uniswap, Lido), logs everything
3. **Reasoning layer** — pluggable LLM (Venice, OpenClaw, OpenAI, etc.) that takes (portfolio + strategy + market) → decisions
4. **Management layer** — web dashboard where human sets strategy, monitors activity, views guardrails

### LLM Provider: Pluggable (Rodrigo's requirement)
- Venice as default demo option (Rodrigo has $50 promo)
- But architecture must be provider-agnostic
- OpenClaw agents, Claude, GPT, local models — all should work
- The on-chain contracts don't care who made the decision

### Onboarding Flow (guided, not a blank prompt)
1. Risk profile — Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive
2. Goals — Preserve Capital / Generate Yield / Growth
3. Allocation — agent proposes based on risk+goals, human approves/adjusts
4. Guardrails — max trade size, daily volume limit → written to AgentPolicy.sol
5. Confirmation — summary, then go

### What to build on the EXISTING app (port 3002, ~/repos/agentguard/app/)
- **DO NOT create new apps. Build on what exists.**
- Add onboarding flow (the guided strategy setup)
- Add portfolio view (real on-chain balances + positions)
- Add activity log (empty for MVP — no fake entries)
- Keep existing real data reads (policy, rates, ENS)
- Add Venice integration when API key is available

### Tracks to target
1. Open Track (always)
2. Agentic Finance / Best Uniswap API Integration (router + swaps)
3. Best Use of Locus (if we integrate wallet management)
4. Private Agents (Venice — if we integrate)
5. Autonomous Trading Agent on Base

### CRITICAL RULE added 2026-03-21
**ONE APP. ONE DIRECTORY. ONE PORT.** The app is `~/repos/agentguard/app/` on port 3002. Do not create new directories, new apps, or new ports. All work happens here. Read this roadmap before every session.

### FIRM DECISIONS added 2026-03-21 (from Rodrigo — DO NOT REVISIT)

10. **Agent NEVER sets its own guardrails.** The HUMAN sets guardrails on the dashboard. The agent cannot change them. If the agent could change its own guardrails, they're not guardrails.

11. **The dashboard is where configuration happens, NOT the chat.** Users toggle protocols on/off on the dashboard. Users set limits on the dashboard. The chat is for the agent to present strategies and answer questions — not for configuration.

12. **The user doesn't know DeFi.** Don't assume they know what staking, APRs, or LP means. The agent figures out the strategy. The user just approves.

13. **The agent assesses risk and proposes strategies.** Based on which protocols the user has ENABLED on the dashboard, the agent uses private inference (Venice) to analyze current market conditions and propose strategies. The user doesn't have to know anything.

14. **The app must add value beyond what the user can do themselves.** If the user can just go to Lido and click "stake," the app is useless. The value is: agent analyzes multiple protocols, finds the best strategy across the ones you've enabled, and executes — all within your guardrails.

### FIRM DECISIONS added 2026-03-21 evening (from Rodrigo — DO NOT REVISIT)

15. **The agent runs AUTONOMOUSLY.** This is not prompt-driven. The user approves a strategy, the agent runs on its own schedule (heartbeat), rebalancing, finding yield, making trades. The dashboard shows what it's doing. The guardrails are the cage.

16. **No manual guardrail sliders before strategy.** The user doesn't know what slippage or max trade size means. The AI proposes strategies WITH guardrails baked in. The user just picks one. Guardrails come FROM the strategy, not before it.

17. **No risk questionnaires.** "Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive" is lazy. The AI should figure out what to do and propose it. The user says yes or no.

18. **Tab-based navigation.** Each feature gets its own page. Vault, Strategy, Activity, Chat, Market, Guardrails. No hidden tabs buried in the middle of a page.

19. **One unified skill file.** Not separate instructions for each feature. One SKILL.md that teaches any agent how to use ALL of AgentGuard (register, deposit, swap, quote, stake, etc.).

20. **Use the Uniswap Trading API.** Not raw V3 SwapRouter02 calls. The hackathon track says "Best Uniswap API" — use their actual API for quotes/routing.

21. **Chat page needs rethinking.** Currently two AI identities: the user's OpenClaw agent (who trades) and a Venice chat agent on the website (who answers questions). This is weird. Parking for now but needs resolution.

### Product Vision (March 21 — iterated with Rodrigo)

**Problem:** "I have crypto doing nothing because DeFi is too complicated, and I don't trust anyone else to manage it."

**Solution:** Your own AI agent manages your DeFi portfolio. You control what it can touch and how much. It figures out the best strategy using private inference (Venice). Nobody else sees your financial data.

**Why this beats alternatives:**
- vs doing it yourself: you don't need to know DeFi
- vs Yearn/Locus vaults: it's YOUR agent, YOUR limits, YOUR strategy choice
- vs just going to Lido: the agent optimizes across MULTIPLE protocols simultaneously
- vs traditional advisors: private AI inference, on-chain enforcement, 24/7

### Product Flow (CURRENT — March 21 evening)

```
1. User connects wallet on dashboard
2. User copies agent instructions → sends to their AI agent (OpenClaw, etc.)
3. Agent curls /api/skill → learns how to use AgentGuard
4. Agent POSTs to /api/agent/register with human's wallet
5. Dashboard detects agent → user clicks "Create Vault" (one wallet TX, ~$0.03)
6. User deposits ETH into vault
7. User goes to Strategy tab → clicks "Show Me Strategies"
8. Venice AI analyzes protocols, yields, market → proposes 3 strategies
   - Each strategy includes guardrails (max trade, daily limit, slippage, protocols)
   - Plain English — user doesn't need to know DeFi
9. User picks a strategy → clicks "Approve & Start Agent"
   - Guardrails written on-chain via updatePolicy()
   - Dashboard shows "Agent Running" with green pulse
10. Agent runs AUTONOMOUSLY on heartbeat:
    - Checks rates, rebalances, swaps, stakes
    - All within on-chain guardrails — can't exceed them
11. User monitors on Activity tab, can chat on Chat tab
12. User can "Pause Agent" anytime (revokes policy on-chain)
```

**Key: everything is flexible.** User can deposit at any time, generate strategies at any time, chat at any time. No forced flow — tabs let them jump to any feature.

### App Layout (Tab-Based)

| Tab | URL | What's There |
|-----|-----|-------------|
| Vault | `/dashboard` | Balances (WETH/USDC), deposit ETH, agent info, create vault |
| Strategy | `/strategy` | AI generates 3 strategies, approve & start agent, pause agent |
| Activity | `/activity` | Trade history with Basescan links |
| Chat | `/chat` | Full-page Venice AI conversation, suggestion prompts |
| Market | `/market` | ETH price, stETH APR, gas, protocol cards |
| Guardrails | `/guardrails` | How enforcement works, current limits, daily usage, approved tokens |

### The AI's Role (INSTRUMENTAL — not secondary, not primary, always present)

The AI is the intelligence layer. Without it, the user can't make decisions because they don't understand DeFi. Without the dashboard, the user can't control anything. Both are the product.

- Analyzes market conditions across enabled protocols
- Generates strategy proposals with plain-English explanations
- Executes the chosen strategy within guardrails
- Available via chat to explain anything, answer questions, suggest changes
- Uses Venice for private inference — financial analysis stays private

## WHAT WE BUILT — FULL TECHNICAL BREAKDOWN

### Layer 1: Smart Contracts (Base Sepolia — all deployed and verified)

**Chain:** Base Sepolia (chain ID 84532)

| Contract | Address | What It Does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **VaultFactory** | `0x672E6aD29eA629398F4Ee29f51ad6Ad3f9869774` | Deploys a new AgentVault + sets policy + approves tokens in ONE transaction |
| **AgentPolicy** | `0x63649f61F29CE6dC9415263F4b727Bc908206Fbc` | Stores per-agent spending rules: per-token limits, per-swap caps, daily ceilings. Human sets these. Agent cannot change its own policy. |
| **AgentGuardRouter** | `0x5Cc04847CE5A81319b55D34F9fB757465D3677E6` | Wraps Uniswap V3 SwapRouter02. Checks AgentPolicy BEFORE executing every swap. If agent exceeds limits → transaction reverts. |
| **AgentVault** (demo instance) | `0x333896c4c1b58c5c9b56967301c008C073Bd2279` | Holds user funds. Tracks principal (original deposit). Agent can only trade yield above principal — cannot touch the original deposit. |

**Verified swap TX:** [`0x1abcce6a0d00eccdc303a4f7197a8b8a4f90b86661059e199dda45d3037422d1`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x1abcce6a0d00eccdc303a4f7197a8b8a4f90b86661059e199dda45d3037422d1) — real swap through the router, policy checked, on Basescan.

**How the contracts connect:**
```
Human creates vault via VaultFactory
  → VaultFactory deploys AgentVault (holds funds)
  → VaultFactory calls AgentPolicy.setPolicy() (spending limits)
  → VaultFactory approves tokens on the vault (which tokens agent can trade)

Agent wants to swap WETH → USDC:
  → Agent calls AgentGuardRouter.swapExactInput()
  → Router calls AgentPolicy.checkPolicy(agent, token, amount)
  → If within limits → Router forwards to Uniswap V3 SwapRouter02
  → If exceeds limits → Transaction reverts (on-chain, automatic)
```

**Key design choices:**
- Principal tracking: vault knows how much was deposited vs. how much is yield. Agent trades yield only.
- Policy is set by the HUMAN wallet. Agent wallet can only read its policy, never change it.
- Router is a wrapper, not a fork. Real Uniswap V3 liquidity underneath.

**What's NOT on mainnet:** Everything is testnet. Path to mainnet = redeploy with chain ID 8453. No code changes needed.

### Layer 2: API Endpoints (Next.js backend — all running on port 3002)

**Server:** `http://100.71.117.120:3002`

| Endpoint | Method | What It Does | Status |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/vault/status` | GET | Returns vault balances, agent info, policy limits | ✅ Working |
| `/api/vault/deposit` | POST | Returns unsigned TX data for depositing ETH into a vault. Agent signs and broadcasts. | ✅ Working (Sepolia) |
| `/api/vault/swap` | POST | Gets a Uniswap Trading API quote, then builds a swap TX through AgentGuardRouter. Returns unsigned TX. | ✅ Working (Sepolia) |
| `/api/vault/stake` | POST | Builds a Lido staking TX (ETH → stETH → wstETH via vault). Returns unsigned TX. | ✅ Working (Sepolia, but no real Lido on Sepolia) |
| `/api/vault/yield` | GET | Reads principal + available yield from the vault contract on-chain | ✅ Working (reads real chain state) |
| `/api/uniswap/quote` | POST | Proxies to Uniswap Trading API (`trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1/quote`) with our API key | ✅ Working (real Uniswap API) |
| `/api/rates` | GET | Live ETH price from CoinGecko, stETH APR from Lido API, gas from Base RPC | ✅ Working (real APIs) |
| `/api/chat` | POST | Venice AI chat endpoint — zero data retention, private inference | ✅ Working (real Venice API) |
| `/api/pipeline` | POST | Venice AI strategy generation — analyzes rates + vault state, proposes strategies with guardrails | ✅ Working (real Venice API) |
| `/api/policy` | GET/POST | Read or set policy on AgentPolicy contract | ✅ Working (Sepolia) |
| `/api/agent/register` | POST | Registers an agent wallet to a vault | ✅ Working (Sepolia) |

**How the API and contracts connect:**
```
Agent (via skill) calls API endpoint
  → API builds unsigned transaction data
  → Returns TX to agent
  → Agent signs with its own wallet
  → Agent broadcasts to Base Sepolia
  → Smart contract executes (with policy checks)
```

The API never holds keys. It builds transactions. The agent signs them. This is the standard pattern — non-custodial.

**External APIs used (all real, all with API keys configured):**
- **Uniswap Trading API** — `trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1/quote` (env: `UNISWAP_API_KEY`)
- **Venice AI** — `api.venice.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` (env: `VENICE_API_KEY`)
- **CoinGecko** — free tier, no key needed
- **Lido** — `eth-api.lido.fi/v1/protocol/steth/apr/sma` (free, no key)
- **Base Sepolia RPC** — default public RPC via viem

### Layer 3: Web Dashboard (Next.js frontend — 6 tabs)

| Tab | URL | What It Shows |
|-----|-----|--------------|
| **Vault** | `/dashboard` | Wallet connection (ConnectKit), vault balances (WETH/USDC), deposit button, agent status, create vault button |
| **Strategy** | `/strategy` | Venice AI generates 2-3 strategies with guardrails baked in. User picks one → "Approve & Start Agent" → agent runs autonomously |
| **Activity** | `/activity` | Trade history pulled from vault events, Basescan links for every TX |
| **Chat** | `/chat` | Full Venice AI chat — ask questions about strategies, DeFi, portfolio. Private inference. |
| **Market** | `/market` | Live ETH price, stETH APR, gas prices, protocol cards (Lido, Uniswap) — all from real APIs |
| **Guardrails** | `/guardrails` | Explains how on-chain enforcement works. Shows current policy limits, daily usage, approved tokens |

**Shared state:** `AgentContext` provider wraps all pages — wallet connection, vault data, rates, agent status all shared.

**Key UX decisions:**
- No forced flow — tabs let user explore any feature in any order
- AI proposes strategies WITH guardrails — user doesn't set slippage or gas limits
- "Create Vault" explains gas fees upfront
- Agent runs autonomously after approval — heartbeat-driven, not prompt-driven

### Layer 4: Agent Skill File

**File:** `skill/SKILL.md` — one unified document that teaches any AI agent to use AgentGuard.

**What the skill covers:**
- How to register as an agent (POST `/api/agent/register`)
- How to deposit ETH (POST `/api/vault/deposit` → sign → broadcast)
- How to swap tokens (POST `/api/vault/swap` → sign → broadcast, policy enforced by router)
- How to stake ETH into Lido (POST `/api/vault/stake`)
- How to check yield (GET `/api/vault/yield`)
- How to check market conditions (GET `/api/rates`)
- How to set up heartbeat monitoring (check vault → check rates → trade if profitable → repeat)

**OpenClaw integration:** Skill includes specific HEARTBEAT.md instructions so an OpenClaw agent can add vault monitoring to its heartbeat cycle.

**Key point:** This isn't locked to our agent. Any agent that can read a markdown file and make HTTP calls can manage a vault through AgentGuard.

### Layer 5: Sponsor Integrations (honest status)

| Sponsor | Integration | How Real Is It |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Venice AI** | Strategy generation + chat, zero-retention inference | ✅ Real — API key configured, responses come from Venice, financial data never stored |
| **Uniswap** | Trading API for quotes via `/api/uniswap/quote`, AgentGuardRouter wraps V3 SwapRouter02 | ✅ Real — API key configured, real quotes returned, real swaps executed through router |
| **Lido** | Vault can stake ETH → stETH, APR pulled from Lido API, principal tracking enables yield-only trading | ⚠️ Partial — APR is real (from Lido API), staking endpoint exists, but no real Lido on Sepolia so staking TX would fail on-chain |
| **Base** | All contracts deployed on Base Sepolia, all TXs on Base | ✅ Real — verified on Basescan |
| **ERC-8004** | Agent has on-chain identity (token #34950) | ✅ Real — minted during registration |

### What Would It Take for Mainnet

1. Deploy 3 contracts to Base mainnet (gas cost: ~$5-10 in ETH)
2. Change chain ID from 84532 → 8453 in API endpoints
3. Lido staking works natively on mainnet (wstETH is live on Base)
4. Update RPC endpoint to mainnet
5. No code changes to contracts or frontend logic

That's it. The architecture is chain-agnostic by design.
